                    Verin Recruitment specialists proved themselves to be very solid and qualified
                    recruiters. Our company required several new Python developers to work remotely.
                    On top of job-specific skills, we had strong requirements for English language
                    proficiency. Verin Recruitment quickly filled the pipeline with high-quality candidates.
                    We were able to fill two positions within less than a month. We are very happy with
                    the new employees we got onboard.

                    minutes. It was amazing! Thanks to the guys, we have a great python developer in
